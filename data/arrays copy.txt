# Binary Search

## Overview
Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding elements or boundaries 
in a sorted array or monotonic function â€” typically O(log n).

## Common Patterns
- Searching in sorted arrays
- Finding lower/upper bounds
- Searching on the answer (min/max conditions)
- Rotated sorted arrays

## Common Problems
- Find first and last occurrence of a number
- Find square root (integer)
- Search in rotated sorted array
- Minimize maximum distance to gas station

## Example Problem
Given an array sorted in ascending order, find the index of a target element. 
If not found, return -1.
