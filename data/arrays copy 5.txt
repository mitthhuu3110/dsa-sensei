# Recursion & Backtracking

## Overview
These involve exploring multiple possible solutions via recursion. 
Backtracking undoes previous decisions when they donâ€™t lead to a valid solution.

## Common Patterns
- Generate all subsets / permutations
- N-Queens / Sudoku
- Combination Sum variations
- Maze pathfinding

## Common Problems
- Subset Sum
- Permutations of a string
- Rat in a maze
- Word Search

## Example Problem
Given an array of distinct integers, return all possible subsets (the power set).
