# Graph Algorithms

## Overview
Graphs represent relationships between entities. 
Commonly represented using adjacency lists or matrices.

## Common Techniques
- BFS / DFS
- Topological Sort
- Dijkstra’s / Bellman-Ford
- Union-Find (Disjoint Set)
- Kruskal’s / Prim’s for MST

## Common Problems
- Detect cycle in graph
- Number of islands
- Shortest path in weighted graph
- Course schedule

## Example Problem
Given a 2D grid of ‘1’s and ‘0’s, find the number of islands.
