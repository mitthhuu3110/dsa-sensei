# Arrays

## Overview
An array is a collection of elements stored in contiguous memory locations. 
Most problems around arrays focus on iteration, partitioning, searching, 
sorting, and applying certain constraints efficiently.

## Common Patterns
- Prefix Sum / Cumulative Sum
- Kadaneâ€™s Algorithm
- Sorting + Two Pointers
- HashMap-based lookups
- Difference Array Technique

## Common Problems
- Two Sum
- Maximum Subarray Sum
- Merge Intervals
- Product of Array Except Self
- Find Missing Number

## Example Problem
Given an array of integers, find the length of the longest subarray with sum 0.
