# Greedy Algorithms

## Overview
Greedy algorithms make the locally optimal choice at each step 
with the hope of finding the global optimum.

## Common Patterns
- Sorting + selection
- Interval scheduling
- Minimum coins / jumps
- Huffman Coding

## Common Problems
- Activity selection problem
- Fractional knapsack
- Minimum number of platforms
- Jump Game

## Example Problem
Given start and end times of activities, select maximum number 
of activities that can be performed by a single person.
