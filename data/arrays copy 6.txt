# Two Pointers

## Overview
Two pointers technique is used when you can use two indices to process elements 
from different ends or directions to reduce complexity from O(n^2) to O(n).

## Common Patterns
- Opposite direction (left and right)
- Same direction (slow and fast pointer)

## Common Problems
- Pair with target sum
- Remove duplicates from sorted array
- Sort colors (Dutch National Flag)
- Trapping rain water

## Example Problem
Given a sorted array and a target, find if there exists a pair that sums to target.
