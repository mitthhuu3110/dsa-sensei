and can be optimized by maintaining a “window” of elements.

- Fixed window (e.g., size k)
- Variable window (based on condition)

## Common Problems
- Maximum sum subarray of size K
- Longest substring without repeating characters
- Minimum window substring
- Count distinct elements in every window

## Example Problem
Given a string, find the length of the longest substring with all unique characters.
